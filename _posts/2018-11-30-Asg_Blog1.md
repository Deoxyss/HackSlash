# Assignment-2 , Question-6


## Question
Using the idea of bash pipes write a example to illustrate the difference between the commands:

* ls /tmp/ foo
* ls /tmp/ foo 2>&1

---


## Answer
By using the ideas of bash pipes, to see the difference between these commands we took the following examples:


| S.No. | Command using bash pipes        | Inference                                                 |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | `ls /tmp/ foo | grep "a"`       | Gives *STDOUT* of `ls /tmp/ foo` to *STDIN* of `grep "a"` |
| 2     | `ls /tmp/ foo 2>&1 | grep "a"`  | The *STDERR* portion of the command is sent to *STDOUT*   |

---

Thus when we pipe to `grep "a"` we will see that lines which normally disappear(since they were written to **STDERR**) are being kept now (because now they are on **STDOUT**) instead.

The ouput of these commands are as shown :
