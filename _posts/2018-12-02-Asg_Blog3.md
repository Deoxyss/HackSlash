import tkinter as tk

n = 4
length = 50 

window = tk.Tk()
window.title("Sliding Puzzle")
window.geometry("200x200")
window.configure(background='gray')

#canvas in tkinter
canvas = tk.Canvas(window, width=201, height=201,bg="gray")
canvas.pack(side=tk.LEFT)

#creating a table of 4x4 tiles
for i in range(n):
    y = i * length
    for j in range(n):
        x = j * length
        canvas.create_rectangle(x+1, y+1, x+1+length, y+1+length,fill="lightgreen")


window.mainloop()
```
