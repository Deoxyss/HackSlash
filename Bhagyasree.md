The two most important things I love are sleeping and eating. There is a replacement for remainig things but for these two there is no replacement.I enjoy eating ,it does'nt mean that I live to eat but whatever I eat I enjoy that.

And finally when it comes to my strengths I'm good in managing things.
I have a good presentation and communication skills. I have leadership qualities since my secondary school. And moreover I'm confident person.
